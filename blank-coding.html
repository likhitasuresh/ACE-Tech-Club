<strong>Gist of the Event:</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main intention of this event was to gather students with an 
inclination to Computer Science and test them on certain aspects in the discipline. The event was divided 
into three rounds. The first consisted of a simple crossword puzzle. Participants who obtained a certain 
score advanced to the second round. For the second round, the participants were randomly paired and asked
to work together on a pick and speak activity. Members who did fairly well moved on to the next round which 
involved using coding skills. The participants were all presented with code snippets and were asked to formulate 
the output. The event was a huge success among the CSE students.</p>
<strong>Beneficiary: </strong>Students of all branches and semesters.
