**Held On**: 5th October, 2018.

**Objective**  
To conduct an event that can provide participants with a mock interview.

**Statement of purpose**  
The event was aimed to provide a simulation of a job placement. All the students of the college were allowed to take part in this event; as a result the technical round was not limited to the Computer Science field. Multiple students participated in this three round event. The first round consisted of aptitude questions. The participants had one minute to solve each question and they were given twenty questions. The participants were then asked to solve fifteen technical questions, in round two. Upon calculating the results for both round one and round two, certain participants were eligible to take part in the third round, which was the Group Discussion round.

**Held On**: 5th October, 2018.

**Objective**  
To conduct an event that will serve an informative purpose with regard to advanced contemporary and emerging technology.

**Statement of Purpose**  
The main intention of this event was to gather students with an inclination to Computer Science and test them on certain aspects in the discipline. The event was divided into three rounds. The first consisted of a simple crossword puzzle. Participants who obtained a certain score advanced to the second round. For the second round, the participants were randomly paired and asked to work together on a pick and speak activity. Members who did fairly well moved on to the next round which involved using coding skills. The participants were all presented with code snippets and were asked to formulate the output. The event was a huge success among the CSE students.
